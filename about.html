                <p>I began learning about computers and how they worked at an early age. Eventually, with the help of my father, I built my own computer from scratch and had a lot of fun doing it. Learning what each part did and how they were all connected and working together was very interesting to me. I wanted to gravitate towards something makes me happy and for me this was it.</p>
                 
                <p>Growing up in Wisconsin there wasnâ€™t a lot to do as a child, and it seemed like there weren't many opportunities as an adult. I always knew that college was something that I wanted to do and it was also a path that led to opportunities outside of Wisconsin. When faced with the prospect of paying for college, it seemed like my only option was student loans. Later on I decided to enter the military and joined the Marine Corps.</p>     
                <p>I chose the Marine Corps because I specifically wanted to earn the title and growing up I was told that they were the best of the best. While I was on active duty, I was a mortar man, which basically is shooting explosives from a tube to a precise location. While launching a mortar seems simple, the math that was needed to deliver a 10 pound mortar round to a location up to three miles away involved meticulous calculations for deflection, elevation, round charge, type of round, weather, and even wind. It was the perfect job for a 21 year old because I got to travel, play with explosives, work outside every day, and be around some great people. Developing friendships with the men that made up the Marine Corps was my favorite part of my experience. I learned a lot about myself when it comes to grit and determination, and the friendships that I made while sharing that experience with others is something that I fondly reflect on.</p>
                     
                <p>My degree program in Computer Science has given me a great foundation and knowledge in the world of technology. I am interested in beginning my career in an entry level position that focuses on front end web development.</p>
